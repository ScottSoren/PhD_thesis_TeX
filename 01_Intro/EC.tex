\begin{itemize}
	\item Transport: more reliance on electric-powered trains, battery vehicles, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Eventually, use electrical energy to make fuels for heavy transport.
	
	\item Buildings: replace fuel heating with electric heat pumps
	
	\item Industry: When possible, replace thermal processes with electrochemical processes. Use electrical heating for others. When possible, replace fossil fuel reactants with electrochemically produced hydrogen.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Overcapacity of renewable generation, geographic diversification
	
	\item Flexible grid elements including battery vehicles
	
	\item Hydrogen energy storage
\end{itemize}
