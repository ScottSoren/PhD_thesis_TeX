\chapter{The Net Carbon Impact of this PhD}\label{ch:impact}

In the first two Sections of this short concluding Chapter, I will estimate the \ch{CO2} emitted and, with much more uncertainty, the expectation value of the \ch{CO2} saved during my PhD project.

A version of this question, rearranged to be a bit more rigorous, is:
\begin{question}
	What portion of a millivolt's increase in efficiency in PEM electrolyzers worldwide in 2030-2040 would have to be attributable to my research in order to offset the \ch{CO2} footprint of my PhD project?
\end{question}

Finally, the last Section will serve as a conclusion and outlook for this Thesis.
