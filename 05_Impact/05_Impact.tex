\chapter{The Net Carbon Impact of this PhD}\label{ch:impact}

In this short concluding Chapter, I will estimate the \ch{CO2} emitted (Section \ref{sec:burning}) and, with much more uncertainty, the expectation value of the \ch{CO2} saved during my PhD project (Section \ref{sec:millivolt}). The idea is to determine whether I have done any net good during the past three years with respect to the climate crisis described in Chapter 1.

A version of this question, rearranged to be a bit more rigorous, is:
\begin{question}
	What portion of a millivolt's improvement in efficiency of PEM electrolyzers worldwide in the year 2030 would have to be attributable to my research in order to offset the \ch{CO2} footprint of my PhD project? \label{q:impact}
\end{question}

Finally, the last Section will serve as a conclusion and outlook for this Thesis.
