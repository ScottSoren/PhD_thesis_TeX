\subsection*{This thesis}

As the months and weeks remaining in my PhD project grew more and more limited, I began to ask myself what I wanted to do with my PhD Thesis. Two answers to that question surfaced, which I have tried to accomplish:
\begin{itemize}
	\item I wanted to get down the scientific ideas that I've had during this PhD project that aren't in articles, especially those that might not ever get into articles.

	\item I wanted to write a PhD thesis that others would find useful and read in the future. 
\end{itemize}
