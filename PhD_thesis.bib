abstract = {The Well-To-Wheels (WTW) methodology is widely used for policy making in the transportation sector. In this paper updated WTW calculations are provided, relying on 2013 statistic data, for the carbon intensity (CI) of the European electricity mix; detail is provided for electricity consumed in each EU Member State (MS). An interesting aspect presented is the calculation of the GHG content of electricity traded between Countries, affecting the carbon intensity of the electricity consumed at national level. The amount and CI of imported electricity is a key aspect: a Country importing electricity from another Country with a lower CI of electricity will lower, after the trade, its electricity CI, while importing electricity from a Country with a higher CI will raise the CI of the importing Country. In average, the CI of electricity used in EU at low voltage in 2013 was 447 gCO2eq/kWh, which is the 17{\%} less compared to 2009. Then, some examples of calculation of GHG emissions from the use of electric vehicles (EVs) compared to internal combustion engine vehicles are provided. The use of EVs instead of gasoline vehicles can save (about 60{\%} of) GHG in all or in most of the EU MSs, depending on the estimated consumption of EVs. Compared with diesel, EVs show average GHG savings of around 50{\%} and not savings at all in some EU MS.},

abstract = {The Balmorel model has been used to calculate the economic optimal energy system configuration for the Scandinavian countries and Germany in 2060 assuming a nearly 100{\%} coverage of the energy demands in the power, heat and transport sector with renewable energy sources. Different assumptions about the future success of fuel cell technologies have been investigated as well as different electricity and heat demand assumptions. The variability of wind power production was handled by varying the hydropower production and the production on CHP plants using biomass, by power transmission, by varying the heat production in heat pumps and electric heat boilers, and by varying the production of hydrogen in electrolysis plants in combination with hydrogen storage. Investment in hydrogen storage capacity corresponded to 1.2{\%} of annual wind power production in the scenarios without a hydrogen demand from the transport sector, and approximately 4{\%} in the scenarios with a hydrogen demand from the transport sector. Even the scenarios without a demand for hydrogen from the transport sector saw investments in hydrogen storage due to the need for flexibility provided by the ability to store hydrogen. The storage capacities of the electricity storages provided by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles were too small to make hydrogen storage superfluous. {\textcopyright} 2010 Professor T.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. The Heat Roadmap Europe (HRE) studies estimated a potential increase of the district heating (DH) share to 50{\%} of the entire heat demand by 2050, with approximately 25-30{\%} of it being supplied using large-scale electric heat pumps. This study builds on this potential and aims to document that such developments can begin now with technologies currently available. We present a database and the status of the technology and its ability of expansion to other European locations by reviewing experiences aimed at further research or application in the heating industry. This is based on a survey of the existing capacity of electric large-scale heat pumps with more than 1 MW thermal output, operating in European DH systems. The survey is the first database of its kind containing the technical characteristics of these heat pumps, and provides the basis for the analysis of this paper. By quantifying the heat sources, refrigerants, efficiency and types of operation of 149 units with 1580 MW of thermal output, the study further uses this data to analyze if the deployment of this technology on a large-scale is possible in other locations in Europe. It finally demonstrates that the technical level of the existing heat pumps is mature enough to make them suitable for replication in other locations in Eur ope.},

abstract = {We analyse the impact of the current and an alternative stricter EU CO2 car legislation on transport related CO2 emissions, on the uptake of electric vehicles (EV), on the reduction of oil consumption, and on total energy system costs beyond 2020. We apply a TIMES based energy system model for Europe. Results for 2030 show that a stricter target of 70 g CO2/km for cars could reduce total transport CO2 emissions by 5{\%} and oil dependence by more than 2{\%} compared to the current legislation. The stricter regulatory CO2 car target is met by a deployment of more efficient internal combustion engine cars and higher shares of EV Total system costs increase by less than 1{\%}. The analysis indicates that EV deployment and the decarbonisation of the power system including higher shares of variable renewables can be synergistic. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the deployment of EV would sharply increase between 2020 and 2030 at learning rates above 12.5{\%}, reaching shares above 30{\%} in 2030. Finally, the study highlights that, besides legislating cars, policies for other transport sectors and modes are needed to curb transport related CO2 emission growth by 2030.},

abstract = {At current primary steel production levels, the iron and steel industry will fail to meet the 80{\%}emission reduction target without introduction of breakthrough technologies (W{\"{o}}rtler et al., 2013: 19). The current research analyses the technical and economical long-term potential of innovative primary steel production technologies in Germany throughout 2100. Techno-economic models are used to simulate three innovative ore-based steelmaking routes verses the reference blast furnace route (BF-BOF). The innovative routes in focus are blast furnace with CCS1 (BF-CCS), hydrogen direct reduction (H-DR), and iron ore electrolysis (EW). Energy and mass flows for the production of one tonne of crude steel (CS) are combined with hypothetical price, cost, and revenue data to evaluate the production routes economically, technically, and environmentally. This is a purely theoretical analysis and hence further external factors that may influence practical implementation or profitability are not considered. Different future developments are considered by using three scenarios, representing an ambitious, a moderate, and a conservative transformation of the German energy sector. In general, looking into the future bares various uncertainties which should be reflected in a suitable manner.According to the present scenario analysis, chances are that with rising prices for coal and CO2 allowances BF-BOF and even BF-CCS become unprofitable by mid-century. With a high share of renewable energy sources and high prices for CO2 allowances, H-DR and EW become economically attractive in the second half of the current century, when BF-based routes are long unprofitable. Energy and raw material efficiency is significantly higher for H-DR and EW and furthermore, the 80{\%}reduction target by 20502 can be achieved in the ambitious scenario. However, high investment costs and high dependency on electricity prices prohibit a profitable implementation before 2030e2040 without further subsidies. EW is the most energy and resource efficient production route. Since continuous electricity is needed for the continuous operation, the electricity costs are 20e40{\%}higher than for H-DR (with high-capacity hydrogen storage units). Even though hydrogen production implies efficiency losses compared to the EW route, the decoupling of hydrogen production from continuous operation of the steel plant through hydrogen storage offers the opportunity to use cheap excess renewable electricity. This makes the H-DR economically and environmentally the most attractive route and provides a crucial contribution to stabilize the grid and to store excess energy in a 100{\%}renewable energy system.},

abstract = {Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power are important for the future energy supply chain, but require suitable energy storage and conversion technologies due to the nature of the intermittency in electricity generation. Solid oxide cell (SOC) is such a highly efficient device which can store the renewable electricity into chemical energy of fuels under solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) operation mode and to regenerate the electricity using the stored fuels under solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operation mode. However, there are significant technological barriers for the commercial viability of SOCs, one of them is the significant performance degradation under the SOEC mode. This paper reviews critically the durability and performance degradation issues of SOCs under SOEC operation conditions and the emphasis is mainly on the physical, chemical and microstructural processes that cause the degradation and their dependence on the operation conditions and nature of the oxygen and hydrogen electrodes and electrolyte materials. The degradation due to the contaminants such as chromium, boron and silica from metallic interconnect, borosilicate glass sealants and/or raw materials is also reviewed. The development of high performance and durable SOECs technology is discussed and based on the observed evidences, the sequence of the delamination processes at the oxygen electrode/YSZ electrolyte has been proposed.},

abstract = {Alkaline water electrolysis is one of the easiest methods for hydrogen production, offering the advantage of simplicity. The challenges for widespread use of water electrolysis are to reduce energy consumption, cost and maintenance and to increase reliability, durability and safety. This literature review examines the current state of knowledge and technology of hydrogen production by water electrolysis and identifies areas where R{\&}D effort is needed in order to improve this technology. Following an overview of the fundamentals of alkaline water electrolysis, an electrical circuit analogy of resistances in the electrolysis system is introduced. The resistances are classified into three categories, namely the electrical resistances, the reaction resistances and the transport resistances. This is followed by a thorough analysis of each of the resistances, by means of thermodynamics and kinetics, to provide a scientific guidance to minimising the resistance in order to achieve a greater efficiency of alkaline water electrolysis. The thermodynamic analysis defines various electrolysis efficiencies based on theoretical energy input and cell voltage, respectively. These efficiencies are then employed to compare different electrolysis cell designs and to identify the means to overcome the key resistances for efficiency improvement. The kinetic analysis reveals the dependence of reaction resistances on the alkaline concentration, ion transfer, and reaction sites on the electrode surface, the latter is determined by the electrode materials. A quantitative relationship between the cell voltage components and current density is established, which links all the resistances and manifests the importance of reaction resistances and bubble resistances. The important effect of gas bubbles formed on the electrode surface and the need to minimise the ion transport resistance are highlighted. The historical development and continuous improvement in the alkaline water electrolysis technology are examined and different water electrolysis technologies are systematically compared using a set of the practical parameters derived from the thermodynamic and kinetic analyses. In addition to the efficiency improvements, the needs for reduction in equipment and maintenance costs, and improvement in reliability and durability are also established. The future research needs are also discussed from the aspects of electrode materials, electrolyte additives and bubble management, serving as a comprehensive guide for continuous development of the water electrolysis technology. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Global civil aviation accounts for 4–5{\%} of total greenhouse gas emissions and these emissions are increasing. In the absence of sufficiently effective global climate instruments, national instruments might be considered as a complement, in which case some way of allocating emissions from international air travel between countries is needed. The purpose of this paper is to develop an accounting method that reflects one country's greenhouse gas emissions from international air travel, and to apply this methodology to Sweden. The new methodology consists of three parts: the number of international air trips made by the country's residents; the average distance of these trips; and the greenhouse gas emissions per passenger km. For Sweden, data for 1990 to 2014 show an increase in the number of trips by Sweden's population of 3.6{\%} per year, resulting in, on average, one international journey (round trip 5800 km) per capita in 2014. The average distance to the final destination has increased only marginally due to simultaneous growth in both long and short trips. However, global average greenhouse gas emissions per passenger km have decreased by 1.9{\%} per year between 1990 and 2014. Because the increase in the number of their trips has outweighed the decrease in emissions per km, the total emissions from Swedish residents' international air travel have increased by 61{\%} between 1990 and 2014. The total emissions from Swedish residents' air travel, including both CO2 and non-CO2-effects, were 11 Mt CO2 equivalents in 2014, which is the same level as the emissions from Swedish car traffic. This type of reliable data is important when designing policies and for getting public support for new policies.},

abstract = {The long-term goal of containing average warming below the 2 °C limit requires deep cuts in emissions from all sectors. The fast growing global aviation industry has committed to reduce carbon emissions. Carbon offsetting is an integral element of the sector's strategy. Already, airlines offer voluntary carbon offsetting to those customers who wish to mitigate the impact of their travel. To ensure carbon offsetting can make a meaningful and credible contribution, this paper first discusses the science behind ‘carbon offsetting', followed by the associated policy perspective. Then, against the context of different aviation emissions pathways, the paper provides empirical evidence of current airline practices in relation to offsetting mechanisms and communication. Building on these insights, the challenges of reducing aviation emissions and using carbon credits to compensate for ongoing growth are discussed. The paper concludes by proposing five principles of best practice for carbon offsetting that airlines can use as a basis to develop credible emissions strategies, and that could inform the sectoral framework currently being developed by leading aviation organisations.},

abstract = {The need for deep decarbonisation in the energy intensive basic materials industry is increasingly recognised. In light of the vast future potential for renewable electricity the implications of electrifying the production of basic materials in the European Union is explored in a what-if thought-experiment. Production of steel, cement, glass, lime, petrochemicals, chlorine and ammonia required 125 TW-hours of electricity and 851 TW-hours of fossil fuels for energetic purposes and 671 TW-hours of fossil fuels as feedstock in 2010. The resulting carbon dioxide emissions were equivalent to 9{\%} of total greenhouse gas emissions in EU28. A complete shift of the energy demand as well as the resource base of feedstocks to electricity would result in an electricity demand of 1713 TW-hours about 1200 TW-hours of which would be for producing hydrogen and hydrocarbons for feedstock and energy purposes. With increased material efficiency and some share of bio-based materials and biofuels the electricity demand can be much lower. Our analysis suggest that electrification of basic materials production is technically possible but could have major implications on how the industry and the electric systems interact. It also entails substantial changes in relative prices for electricity and hydrocarbon fuels.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA. Methanol, an important chemical, fuel additive, and precursor for clean fuels, is produced by hydrogenation of carbon oxides over Cu-based catalysts. Despite the technological maturity of this process, the understanding of this apparently simple reaction is still incomplete with regard to the reaction mechanism and the active sites. Regarding the latter, recent progress has shown that stepped and ZnO x -decorated Cu surfaces are crucial for the performance of industrial catalysts. Herein, we integrate this insight with additional experiments into a full microkinetic description of methanol synthesis. In particular, we show how the presence or absence of the Zn promoter dramatically changes not only the activity, but unexpectedly the reaction mechanism itself. The Janus-faced character of Cu with two different sites for methanol synthesis, Zn-promoted and unpromoted, resolves the long-standing controversy regarding the Cu/Zn synergy and adds methanol synthesis to the few major industrial catalytic processes that are described on an atomic level.},

abstract = {The electrochemical synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen under mild conditions and using renewable electricity is in principle an attractive alternative1–4 to the demanding, energy-intense Haber–Bosch process, which dominates industrial ammonia production. However, the electrochemical alternative faces considerable scientific and technical challenges5,6 and most experimental studies reported thus far achieve only low selectivities and conversions. In fact, the amount of ammonia produced is usually so small that it is difficult to firmly attribute it to electrochemical nitrogen fixation7–9 and exclude contamination due to ammonia that is either present in air, human breath or ion-conducting membranes9, or generated from labile nitrogen-containing compounds (for example, nitrates, amines, nitrites and nitrogen oxides) that are typically present in the nitrogen gas stream10, in the atmosphere or even the catalyst itself. Although these many and varied sources of potential experimental artefacts are beginning to be recognized and dealt with11,12, concerted efforts to develop effective electrochemical nitrogen reduction processes would benefit from benchmarking protocols for the reaction and from a standardized set of control experiments to identify and then eliminate or quantify contamination sources. Here we put forward such a rigorous procedure that, by making essential use of 15N2, allows us to reliably detect and quantify the electroreduction of N2 to NH3. We demonstrate experimentally the significance of various sources of contamination and show how to remove labile nitrogen-containing compounds present in the N2 gas and how to perform quantitative isotope measurements with cycling of 15N2 gas to reduce both contamination and the cost of isotope measurements. Following this protocol, we obtain negative results when using the most promising pure metal catalysts in aqueous media, and successfully confirm and quantify ammonia synthesis using lithium electrodeposition in tetrahydrofuran13.},

abstract = {The hydrogen oxidation and evolution reaction (HOR/HER) behavior of carbon supported metal (Pt, Ir, Rh, Pd) nanoparticle electrocatalysts is studied using the H-2 pump approach, in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) setup. After describing the best method for normalizing the net faradaic currents to the active surface area of the electrodes, we measure the HOR/HER kinetic parameters (exchange current densities and transfer coefficients) in a temperature range from 313 K to 353 K and calculate the activation energy for the HOR/HER process. We compare the measured kinetic parameters with those extracted from different mass-transport limitation free setups in literature, to evaluate the hydrogen electrocatalysis on these most active surfaces. The HOR/HER activity scales with the following: Pt {\textgreater} Ir {\textgreater}{\textgreater} Rh {\textgreater} Pd. The anodic and cathodic transfer coefficients are similar for all metals (ca. 0.5), leading to Tafel slopes of ca. 140 mV/decade at 353 K (except for the anodic branch of Pd and the cathodic branch of Rh). The lowest activation energies are found for Pt and Ir (approximate to 20 kJ/mol). For Rh and Pd, higher activation energies are found (approximate to 30 kJ/mol), and attributed to the formation of surface oxides and hydride phase, respectively. (C) The Author(s) 2014.

These models indicate a median remaining budget of 55 PgC (ref.10, base period: year 1870) left to emit from January 2016, the equivalent to approximately five years of emissions at the 2015 rate11,12. Here we calculate warming and carbon budgets relative to the decade 2006-2015, which eliminates model-observation differences in the climate-carbon response over the historical period9, and increases the median remaining carbon budget to 208 PgC (33-66{\%} range of 130-255 PgC) from January 2016 (with mean warming of 0.89 °C for 2006-2015 relative to 1861-188013-18). There is little sensitivity to the observational data set used to infer warming that has occurred, and no significant dependence on the choice of emissions scenario.

abstract = {More than 100 countries have adopted a global warming limit of 2 degrees C or below (relative to pre-industrial levels) as a guiding principle for mitigation efforts to reduce climate change risks, impacts and damages. However, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions corresponding to a specified maximum warming are poorly known owing to uncertainties in the carbon cycle and the climate response. Here we provide a comprehensive probabilistic analysis aimed at quantifying GHG emission budgets for the 2000-50 period that would limit warming throughout the twenty-first century to below 2 degrees C, based on a combination of published distributions of climate system properties and observational constraints. We show that, for the chosen class of emission scenarios, both cumulative emissions up to 2050 and emission levels in 2050 are robust indicators of the probability that twenty-first century warming will not exceed 2 degrees C relative to pre-industrial temperatures. Limiting cumulative CO(2) emissions over 2000-50 to 1,000 Gt CO(2) yields a 25{\%} probability of warming exceeding 2 degrees C-and a limit of 1,440 Gt CO(2) yields a 50{\%} probability-given a representative estimate of the distribution of climate system properties. As known 2000-06 CO(2) emissions were approximately 234 Gt CO(2), less than half the proven economically recoverable oil, gas and coal reserves can still be emitted up to 2050 to achieve such a goal. Recent G8 Communiqu{\'{e}}s envisage halved global GHG emissions by 2050, for which we estimate a 12-45{\%} probability of exceeding 2 degrees C-assuming 1990 as emission base year and a range of published climate sensitivity distributions. Emissions levels in 2020 are a less robust indicator, but for the scenarios considered, the probability of exceeding 2 degrees C rises to 53-87{\%} if global GHG emissions are still more than 25{\%} above 2000 levels in 2020.},

@article{LeQuere2018,
abstract = {Abstract. Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere – the “global carbon budget” – is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify all major components of the global carbon budget, including their uncertainties, based on the combination of a range of data, algorithms, statistics, and model estimates and their interpretation by a broad scientific community. We discuss changes compared to previous estimates and consistency within and among components, alongside methodology and data limitations. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry (EFF) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, respectively, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on combined evidence from land-cover change data, fire activity associated with deforestation, and models. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The mean ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is based on observations from the 1990s, while the annual anomalies and trends are estimated with ocean models. The variability in SOCEAN is evaluated with data products based on surveys of ocean CO2 measurements. The global residual terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated by the difference of the other terms of the global carbon budget and compared to results of independent dynamic global vegetation models. We compare the mean land and ocean fluxes and their variability to estimates from three atmospheric inverse methods for three broad latitude bands. All uncertainties are reported as ±1$\sigma$, reflecting the current capacity to characterise the annual estimates of each component of the global carbon budget. For the last decade available (2006–2015), EFF was 9.3±0.5GtCyr−1, ELUC 1.0±0.5GtCyr−1, GATM 4.5±0.1GtCyr−1, SOCEAN 2.6±0.5GtCyr−1, and SLAND 3.1±0.9GtCyr−1. For year 2015 alone, the growth in EFF was approximately zero and emissions remained at 9.9±0.5GtCyr−1, showing a slowdown in growth of these emissions compared to the average growth of 1.8{\%}yr−1 that took place during 2006–2015. Also, for 2015, ELUC was 1.3±0.5GtCyr−1, GATM was 6.3±0.2GtCyr−1, SOCEAN was 3.0±0.5GtCyr−1, and SLAND was 1.9±0.9GtCyr−1. GATM was higher in 2015 compared to the past decade (2006–2015), reflecting a smaller SLAND for that year. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 399.4±0.1ppm averaged over 2015. For 2016, preliminary data indicate the continuation of low growth in EFF with +0.2{\%} (range of −1.0 to +1.8{\%}) based on national emissions projections for China and USA, and projections of gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. In spite of the low growth of EFF in 2016, the growth rate in atmospheric CO2 concentration is expected to be relatively high because of the persistence of the smaller residual terrestrial sink (SLAND) in response to El Ni{\~{n}}o conditions of 2015–2016. From this projection of EFF and assumed constant ELUC for 2016, cumulative emissions of CO2 will reach 565±55GtC (2075±205GtCO2) for 1870–2016, about 75{\%} from EFF and 25{\%} from ELUC. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new carbon budget compared with previous publications of this data set (Le Qu{\'{e}}r{\'{e}} et al., 2015b, a, 2014, 2013). All observations presented here can be downloaded from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (doi:10.3334/CDIAC/GCP{\_}2016).},

Also disturbance of natural decay of dead biomass when used for energy affect the carbon dynamics of forest ecosystems. These perturbations of forest ecosystems are summarized under the concept of carbon debt and its payback time. Narrative reviews demonstrate that the payback time of apparently comparable forest bioenergy supply scenarios vary by up to 200 years allowing amble room for confusion and dispute about the climate benefits of forest bioenergy. This meta-analysis confirm that the outcome of carbon debt studies lie in the assumptions and find that methodological rather than ecosystem and management related assumptions determine the findings. The study implies that at the current development of carbon debt methodologies and their lack of consensus the concept in it-self is inadequate for informing and guiding policy development. At the management level the carbon debt concept may provide valuable information directing management principles in a more climate benign directions.},

Reactions involving dissociation of Ha2, D2, O2, OH, NH, and CH bonds proceed on the stepped surfaces with much higher reaction probabilities than reactions requiring dissociation of N2, or CO bonds.

abstract = {Land-use changes are critical for climate policy because native vegetation and soils store abundant carbon and their losses from agricultural expansion, together with emissions from agricultural production, contribute about 20 to 25 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions1,2. Most climate strategies require maintaining or increasing land-based carbon3 while meeting food demands, which are expected to grow by more than 50 per cent by 20501,2,4. A finite global land area implies that fulfilling these strategies requires increasing global land-use efficiency of both storing carbon and producing food. Yet measuring the efficiency of land-use changes from the perspective of greenhouse gas emissions is challenging, particularly when land outputs change, for example, from one food to another or from food to carbon storage in forests. Intuitively, if a hectare of land produces maize well and forest poorly, maize should be the more efficient use of land, and vice versa. However, quantifying this difference and the yields at which the balance changes requires a common metric that factors in different outputs, emissions from different agricultural inputs (such as fertilizer) and the different productive potentials of land due to physical factors such as rainfall or soils. Here we propose a carbon benefits index that measures how changes in the output types, output quantities and production processes of a hectare of land contribute to the global capacity to store carbon and to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions. This index does not evaluate biodiversity or other ecosystem values, which must be analysed separately. We apply the index to a range of land-use and consumption choices relevant to climate policy, such as reforesting pastures, biofuel production and diet changes. We find that these choices can have much greater implications for the climate than previously understood because standard methods for evaluating the effects of land use4–11 on greenhouse gas emissions systematically underestimate the opportunity of land to store carbon if it is not used for agriculture.},

abstract = {Oxidation of CO on platinum nanoparticles ranging in size from 1 to 30 nm has been studied in acid electrolytes. We found that Pt nanoparticles, characterized by transmission electron microscopy, are not perfect cubo-octahedrons and that large particles have "rougher" surfaces than small particles. The importance of "defect" sites for the catalytic properties of nanoparticles was probed by using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) and rotating disk electrode. From IRAS experiments, by monitoring how the vibrational frequency of a-top CO ($\nu$CO) as well as the concomitant development of dissolved CO2 are affected by the number of defects on Pt nanoparticles, we suggested that defects play a significant role in CO "clustering" on nanoparticles, causing CO to decrease/increase in local coverage, which results in anomalous redshift/blueshift $\nu$CO frequency deviations from the normal Stark-tuning behavior. The observed $\nu$CO deviations are accompanied by CO2 production, which increases by increasing the number of defects on the nanoparticles, i.e., 1 ≤ 2 {\textless} 5 ℓ 30 nm. We suggest that the catalytic activity for CO adlayer oxidation (CO stripping) is predominantly influenced by the ability of the surface to dissociate water and to form OHad on defect sites. We demonstrate that the catalytic activity of Pt nanoparticles for CO oxidation under the condition of continuous CO supply to the surface depends on the pre-history of the electrode. If the surface is precovered by CO, the particle size has a negligible effect on CO oxidation. However, on an oxide-precovered surface CO bulk oxidation increases with decreasing particle size, i.e., with increasing oxophilicity of the particles. We found, if specific sites on the surface are active for OH adsorption, then the electrocatalytic activity for CO oxidation changes as the concentration of these sites changes with particle size. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Ganassin2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Studies over the entropy of components forming the electrode/electrolyte interface can give fundamental insights into the properties of electrified interphases. In particular, the potential where the entropy of formation of the double layer is maximal (potential of maximum entropy, PME) is an important parameter for the characterization of electrochemical systems. Indeed, this parameter determines the majority of electrode processes. In this work, w e determine PMEs for Ir(111) electrodes. The latter currently play an important role to understand electrocatalysis for energy provision; and at the same time, iridium is one of the most stable metals against corrosion. For the experiments, we used a combination of the laser induced potential transient to determine the PME, and CO charge-displacement to determine the potentials of zero total charge, (EPZTC). Both PME and EPZTC were assessed for perchlorate solutions in the pH range from 1 to 4. Surprisingly, we found that those are located in the potential region where the adsorption of hydrogen and hydroxyl species takes place, respectively. The PMEs demonstrated a shift by ∼30 mV per a pH unit (in the RHE scale). Connections between the PME and electrocatalytic properties of the electrode surface are discussed.},

abstract = {The activity of heterogeneous catalysts—which are involved in some 80 per cent of processes in the chemical and energy industries— is determined by the electronic structure of specific surface sites that offer optimal binding of reaction intermediates. Directly identifying and monitoring these sites during a reaction should therefore provide insight that might aid the targeted development of heterogeneous catalysts and electrocatalysts (those that participate in electrochemical reactions) for practical applications. The invention of the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM)1,2 and the electrochemical STM3,4 promised to deliver such imaging capabilities, and both have indeed contributed greatly to our atomistic understanding of heterogeneous catalysis5–8. But although the STM has been used to probe and initiate surface reactions9,10, and has even enabled local measurements of reactivity in some systems11–13, it is not generally thought to be suited to the direct identification of catalytically active surface sites under reaction conditions. Here we demonstrate, however, that common STMs can readily map the catalytic activity of surfaces with high spatial resolution: we show that by monitoring relative changes in the tunnelling current noise, active sites can be distinguished in an almost quantitative fashion according to their ability to catalyse the hydrogen-evolution reaction or the oxygen-reduction reaction. These data allow us to evaluate directly the importance and relative contribution to overall catalyst activity of different defects and sites at the boundaries between two materials. With its ability to deliver such information and its ready applicability to different systems, we anticipate that our method will aid the rational design of heterogeneous catalysts.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide is a potential carbon resource abundant on earth. It is also a green house gas with a rapidly increasing atmospheric concentration during the last two centuries. Chemical fixation of CO2 is an attractive technique for utilization of carbon resources, as well as for the reduction of the atmospheric concentration of CO2. Nevertheless, CO2 is the stablest among carbon based substances under the environmental conditions. It has not been incorporated as a major industrial material. Carbon dioxide can be electrochemically reduced to useful products under mild conditions. However, the energy conversion efficiency, defined as the ratio of the free energy of the products obtained in electrochemical CO2 reduction and that consumed in the reduction, would be roughly 30 to 40{\%}. Such a low efficiency may discourage practical application of CO2 reduction in the very near future. However, the significance of the CO2 reduc- tion will be reevaluated in various aspects of science in future, since many interesting facts in basic electrochemistry have been revealed by recent studies. At the moment, electrochemical reduction of CO2 is an interesting as well as an important topic in chemistry. Fundamental studies of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 started as early as the 19th century, and have been further promoted by many workers in recent years. Numerous reports have been published in the last two decades. At the same time, confusions and contradictions are found in this field. This article attempts to provide a review of CO2 reduction at metal electrodes. Several review papers have already appeared, which contain the history and classical works of CO2 reduction. Thus this paper will not repeat the historical aspects of CO2 reduction. This chapter will review recent progress, putting emphasis on basic problems and particularly on electrocatalytic aspects.},

In this paper, the concept of the sniffer-chip is thoroughly explained and it is shown how it can be used to quantify hydrogen and oxygen evolution on a polycrystalline platinum thin film in situ at absolute faradaic currents down to ∼30 nA.

abstract = {Mixed bimetallic oxides offer great opportunities for a systematic tuning of electrocatalytic activity and stability. Here, we demonstrate the power of this strategy using well- defined thermally prepared Ir−Ni mixed oxide thin film catalysts for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under highly corrosive conditions such as in acidic proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers and photoelectrochemical cells (PEC). Variation of the Ir to Ni ratio resulted in a volcano type OER activity curve with an unprecedented 20-fold improvement in Ir mass-based activity over pure Ir oxide. In situ spectroscopic probing of metal dissolution indicated that, against common views, activity and stability are not directly anticorrelated. To uncover activity and stability controlling parameters, the Ir−Ni mixed thin oxide film catalysts were characterized by a wide array of spectroscopic, microscopic, scattering, and electrochemical techniques in conjunction with DFT theoretical computations. By means of an intuitive model for the formation of the catalytically active state of the bimetallic Ir−Ni oxide surface, we identify the coverage of reactive surface hydroxyl groups as a suitable descriptor for the OER activity and relate it to controllable synthetic parameters. Overall, our study highlights a novel, highly active oxygen evolution catalyst; moreover, it provides novel important insights into the structure and performance of bimetallic oxide OER electrocatalysts in corrosive acidic environments.},

abstract = {There are several hydrogen production technologies. They range from the most widely used fossil fuel based systems such as natural gas steam methane reforming to the least used renewable energy based systems such as wind electrolysis. Currently almost all the industrial hydrogen need worldwide is produced using fossil fuels. Electrolytic hydrogen production based on electricity generated from renewable resources and hydrogen's energetic use could contribute to the global need for a sustainable energy supply. However, these technologies are also not free from environmental burdens. A life cycle assessment (LCA) helps to identify such impacts considering the entire life cycle of the process chains. This paper reviews twenty-one studies that address the LCA of hydrogen production technologies, a majority of them employing electrolytic technologies. It has been observed that global warming potential (GWP) is the impact category analyzed by almost all the authors. Acidification potential (AP) ranks second. Other categories such as toxicity potential are often not analyzed. The main environmental concern associated with electrolytic hydrogen production is electricity supply. The GWP contribution of the electrolyzer unit is relatively small (e.g. only about 4{\%} in wind based electrolysis including hydrogen production and storage systems). From an LCA perspective, it can be concluded that electrolysis using wind or hydropower generated electricity is one of the best hydrogen production technologies, compared to those using conventional grid electricity mix or fossil fuel feedstocks.},

A dramatic increase in the catalytic activity and selectivity for H2 and CO was observed with decreasing Cu particle size, in particular, for NPs below 5 nm. Hydrocarbon (methane and ethylene) selectivity was increasingly suppressed for nanoscale Cu surfaces. The size dependence of the surface atomic coordination of model spherical Cu particles was used to rationalize the experimental results. Changes in the population of low-coordinated surface sites and their stronger chemisorption were linked to surging H2 and CO selectivities, higher catalytic activity, and smaller hydrocarbon selectivity. The presented activity-selectivity-size relations provide novel insights in the CO2 electroreduction reaction on nanoscale surfaces.

We assess the potential involvement of lattice oxygen in the OER mechanism with online electrochemical mass spectrometry, which showed no evidence of oxygen exchange on these oriented facets in acidic or basic electrolytes. Similar results were obtained for polyoriented RuO2 films and particles, in contrast to previous work, suggesting lattice oxygen is not exchanged in catalyzing OER on crystalline RuO2 surfaces. This hypothesis is supported by the correlation of activity with the number of active Ru-sites calculated by density functional theory, where more active facets bind oxygen more weakly. This new understanding of the active sites provides a design strategy to enhance the OER activity of RuO2 nanoparticles by facet engineering.},

abstract = {Electrochemistry will play a vital role in creating sustainable energy solutions in the future, particularly for the conversion and storage of electrical into chemical energy in electrolysis cells, and the reverse conversion and utilization of the stored energy in galvanic cells. The common challenge in both processes is the development of-preferably abundant-nanostructured materials that can catalyze the electrochemical reactions of interest with a high rate over a sufficiently long period of time. An overall understanding of the related processes and mechanisms occurring under the operation conditions is a necessity for the rational design of materials that meet these requirements. A promising strategy to develop such an understanding is the investigation of the impact of material properties on reaction activity/selectivity and on catalyst stability under the conditions of operation, as well as the application of complementary in situ techniques for the investigation of catalyst structure and composition.},

The Tafel slopes used to evaluate the rate determining steps generally assume extreme coverage of the adsorbed species ($\theta$ ≈ 0 or ≈1), although, in practice, the slopes are coverage-dependent. We conducted detailed kinetic analyses describing the coverage-dependent Tafel slopes for the aforementioned reactions. Our careful analyses provide a general benchmark for experimentally observed Tafel slopes that can be assigned to specific rate determining steps. The Tafel analysis is a powerful tool for discussing the rate determining steps involved in electrocatalysis, but our study also demonstrated that overly simplified assumptions led to an inaccurate description of the surface electrocatalysis. Additionally, in many studies, Tafel analyses have been performed in conjunction with the Butler-Volmer equation, where its applicability regarding only electron transfer kinetics is often overlooked. Based on the derived kinetic description of the HER/HOR as an example, the limitation of Butler-Volmer expression in electrocatalysis is also discussed in this report.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by the Authors. High oxygen evolution reaction activity of ruthenium and long term stability of iridium in acidic electrolytes make their mixed oxides attractive candidates for utilization as anodes in water electrolyzers. Indeed, such materials were addressed in numerous previous studies. The application of a scanning flow cell connected to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer allowed us now to examine the stability and activity toward oxygen evolution reaction of such mixed oxides in parallel. The whole composition range of Ir-Ru mixtures has been covered in a thin film material library. In the whole composition range the rate of Ru dissolution is observed to be much higher than that of Ir. Eventually, due to the loss of Ru, the activity of the mixed oxides approaches the value corresponding to pure IrO 2 . Interestingly, the loss of only a few percent of a monolayer in Ru surface concentration results in a significant drop in activity. Several explanations of this phenomenon are discussed. It is concluded that the herein observed stability of mixed Ir-Ru oxide systems is most likely a result of high corrosion resistance of the iridium component, but not due to an alteration of the material's electronic structure.},

However, the origin of the anomalous pseudocapacitance, exhibiting a strong maximum at a specific narrow optimum annealing temperature of ca. 150 °C, has yet to be understood. Here we show a long-awaited explanation for this mystery based on its hierarchical nanostructure unveiled by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The striking contrast in X-ray atomic scattering factors enables SAXS to exclusively probe heavy RuO 2 in subnano-to nanoscale, dispersed in confined water. We demonstrate that the surface area of the first aggregate of subnano primary RuO 2 particles dominates the accessible number of proton and hence pseudocapacitance, providing critical insights into the nanoarchitectural design of high-performance electrodes for electrochemical capacitors.},

abstract = {Objective evaluation of the activity of electrocatalysts for water oxidation is of fundamental importance for the development of promising energy conversion technologies including integrated solar water-splitting devices, water electrolyzers, and Li-air batteries. However, current methods employed to evaluate oxygen-evolving catalysts are not standardized, making it difficult to compare the activity and stability of these materials. We report a protocol for evaluating the activity, stability, and Faradaic efficiency of electrodeposited oxygen-evolving electrocatalysts. In particular, we focus on methods for determining electrochemically active surface area and measuring electrocatalytic activity and stability under conditions relevant to an integrated solar water-splitting device. Our primary figure of merit is the overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) per geometric area, approximately the current density expected for a 10{\%} efficient solar-to-fuels conversion device. Utilizing the aforementioned surface area measurements, one can determine electrocatalyst turnover frequencies. The reported protocol was used to examine the oxygen-evolution activity of the following systems in acidic and alkaline solutions: CoO(x), CoPi, CoFeO(x), NiO(x), NiCeO(x), NiCoO(x), NiCuO(x), NiFeO(x), and NiLaO(x). The oxygen-evolving activity of an electrodeposited IrO(x) catalyst was also investigated for comparison. Two general observations are made from comparing the catalytic performance of the OER catalysts investigated: (1) in alkaline solution, every non-noble metal system achieved 10 mA cm(-2) current densities at similar operating overpotentials between 0.35 and 0.43 V, and (2) every system but IrO(x) was unstable under oxidative conditions in acidic solutions.},

abstract = {Nickel iron oxide is identified as a benchmark non‐precious catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the nature of the active site in nickel iron oxide is heavily debated. Here we report direct spectroscopic evidence for the different active sites in Fe‐free and Fe‐containing Ni oxides. We employ ultrathin layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as defined samples of metal oxide catalysts, and use 18O labelling experiments in combination with in‐situ Raman spectroscopy to probe the role of lattice oxygen as well as an active oxygen species, NiOO‐ in these catalysts. Our data show that lattice oxygen is in involved in OER for Ni and NiCo LDHs, but not for NiFe and NiCoFe LDHs. Moreover, NiOO‐ is a precursor to oxygen for Ni and NiCo LDHs, but not for NiFe and NiCoFe LDHs. These data indicate that in Ni and NiCo oxides, bulk Ni sites are active and evolve oxygen via a NiOO‐ precursor. Fe incorporation not only dramatically increases the activity, but also changes the nature of the active sites, which are now surface active sites mostly likely based on Fe.},

abstract = {A new mass selection technique has been developed, which allows one to size-select charged particles from atoms to nanoparticles of almost unlimited size. It provides a mass resolution of m/$\Delta$m = 20-50 and a transmission of about 50{\%} for the selected size, both independent of mass. The technique is based on the time-of-flight principle, but differs fundamentally from time-of-flight mass selection normally used. The basic idea is to use time-limited high voltage pulses to displace laterally a preaccelerated ion beam, without changing its direction or shape. As the movement of the ions perpendicular to their original beam direction is independent of their forward velocity, mass resolution and calibration does not depend on the ion beam energy. A mass selector of this type has been implemented successfully into a cluster deposition experiment and has proven to be reliable and simple to operate. {\textcopyright} 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Objective evaluation of the activity of electrocatalysts for water oxidation is of fundamental importance for the development of promising energy conversion technologies including integrated solar water-splitting devices, water electrolyzers, and Li-air batteries. However, current methods employed to evaluate oxygen-evolving catalysts are not standardized, making it difficult to compare the activity and stability of these materials. We report a protocol for evaluating the activity, stability, and Faradaic efficiency of electrodeposited oxygen-evolving electrocatalysts. In particular, we focus on methods for determining electrochemically active surface area and measuring electrocatalytic activity and stability under conditions relevant to an integrated solar water-splitting device. Our primary figure of merit is the overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) per geometric area, approximately the current density expected for a 10{\%} efficient solar-to-fuels conversion device. Utilizing the aforementioned surface area measurements, one can determine electrocatalyst turnover frequencies. The reported protocol was used to examine the oxygen-evolution activity of the following systems in acidic and alkaline solutions: CoO(x), CoPi, CoFeO(x), NiO(x), NiCeO(x), NiCoO(x), NiCuO(x), NiFeO(x), and NiLaO(x). The oxygen-evolving activity of an electrodeposited IrO(x) catalyst was also investigated for comparison. Two general observations are made from comparing the catalytic performance of the OER catalysts investigated: (1) in alkaline solution, every non-noble metal system achieved 10 mA cm(-2) current densities at similar operating overpotentials between 0.35 and 0.43 V, and (2) every system but IrO(x) was unstable under oxidative conditions in acidic solutions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Reducing the noble metal loading and increasing the specific activity of the oxygen evolution catalysts are omnipresent challenges in proton-exchange-membrane water electrolysis, which have recently been tackled by utilizing mixed oxides of noble and non-noble elements. However, proper verification of the stability of these materials is still pending. Here we introduce a metric to explore the dissolution processes of various iridium-based oxides, defined as the ratio between the amounts of evolved oxygen and dissolved iridium. The so-called stability number is independent of loading, surface area or involved active sites and provides a reasonable comparison of diverse materials with respect to stability. The case study on iridium-based perovskites shows that leaching of the non-noble elements in mixed oxides leads to the formation of highly active amorphous iridium oxide, the instability of which is explained by the generation of short-lived vacancies that favour dissolution. These insights are meant to guide further research, which should be devoted to increasing the utilization of highly durable pure crystalline iridium oxide and finding solutions to stabilize amorphous iridium oxides.},

At higher potentials an additional mechanism involving an exchange of the oxygen between electrolyte and electrocatalyst starts to apply.

A technique is described which allows performance data for a commercial electrolyzer to be decomposed to give the ohmic resistance contribution as well as the sum of the Tafel slopes for the anodic and cathodic processes. Substantial time variation of both the anode and cathode overvoltages was observed, with the rate and magnitude of this variation being dependent on current density. In light of these results, appropriate methods for long‐term evaluation of new electrode materials are discussed, and a reliable long‐term‐test cell is described.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS. All rights reserved. Although polymer electrolyte water electrolyzers (PEWEs) have been used in small-scale (kW to tens of kW range) applications for several decades, PEWE technology for hydrogen production in energy applications (power-to-gas, power-to-fuel, etc.) requires significant improvements in the technology to address the challenges associated with cost, performance and durability. Systems with power of hundreds of kW or even MWs, corresponding to hydrogen production rates of around 10 to 20 kg/h, have started to appear in the past 5 years. The thin (∼0.2 mm) polymer electrolyte in the PEWE with low ohmic resistance, compared to the alkaline cell with liquid electrolyte, allows operation at high current densities of 1-3 A/cm2 and high differential pressure. This article, after an introductory overview of the operating principles of PEWE and state-of-the-art, discusses the state of understanding of key phenomena determining and limiting performance, durability, and commercial readiness, identifies important 'gaps' in understanding and essential development needs to bring PEWE science {\&} engineering forward to prosper in the energy market as one of its future backbone technologies. For this to be successful, science, engineering, and process development as well as business and market development need to go hand in hand.},

abstract = { High coverage of the catalyst surface generated by in situ degradation of propene steers the reaction towards allylic oxidation.  The efficient partial oxidation of hydrocarbons to valuable chemicals without formation of CO 2 is one of the great challenges in heterogeneous catalysis. The ever-decreasing cost of renewable electricity and the superior control over reactivity qualify electrochemistry as a particularly attractive means of addressing this challenge. Yet, to date, little is known about the factors regulating hydrocarbon oxidation at the atomic level. A relevant showcase reaction is propene electro-oxidation to key industrial commodity chemicals, such as acrolein, acrylic acid and propylene oxide. In this study, we investigate the partial electrochemical oxidation of propene on high-surface area Pd electrodes using a combination of electrochemical measurements, advanced product characterization and theoretical modeling. We report a new reaction product, propylene glycol, and high selectivity towards acrolein. We further identify key reaction intermediates and propose a mechanism dictated by the surface coverage of organic species formed in situ , where stable reactant adsorption at low coverage determines the selectivity towards allylic oxidation at high coverage. Our fundamental findings enable advances in partial hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by highlighting atomic surface structuring as the key to selective and versatile electrochemical catalyst design. },

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Chemical Society. The roles of hydrogen impurity and oxygen vacancy defects on defining the conductivity, and hence photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance characteristics, of monoclinic scheelite bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) are investigated using a combination of experiment and theory. We find that elemental hydrogen is present as an impurity in as-synthesized BiVO 4 and that increasing its concentration by annealing in H 2 at temperatures up to 290 °C leads to near-complete elimination of majority carrier transport limitations, a beneficial shift in the photoanodic current onset potential, and improved fill factor. Magnetic resonance measurements reveal that hydrogen can be incorporated in at least two different chemical environments, which are assigned to interstitial and substitutional sites. Incorporation of hydrogen leads to a shift of the Fermi level toward the conduction band edge, indicating that n-type character is correlated with increased hydrogen content. This finding is in agreement with theory and reveals that hydrogen acts as a donor in BiVO 4 . Sub-bandgap photoluminescence is observed from as-synthesized material and is consistent with deep electronic states associated with oxygen vacancies. Hydrogen treatment leads to reduced emission from these states. These findings support the conclusion that hydrogen, rather than oxygen vacancies, is dominant in determining the n-type conductivity of BiVO 4 . These findings have important implications for controlling the electronic properties and functional characteristics of this promising photoanode material.},

But, high capital cost and uncertainty regarding future cost and performance improvements are barriers to investment in water electrolysis. Expert elicitations can support decision-making when data are sparse and their future development uncertain. Therefore, this study presents expert views on future capital cost, lifetime and efficiency for three electrolysis technologies: alkaline (AEC), proton exchange membrane (PEMEC) and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC). Experts estimate that increased R{\&}D funding can reduce capital costs by 0–24{\%}, while production scale-up alone has an impact of 17–30{\%}. System lifetimes may converge at around 60,000–90,000 h and efficiency improvements will be negligible. In addition to innovations on the cell-level, experts highlight improved production methods to automate manufacturing and produce higher quality components. Research into SOECs with lower electrode polarisation resistance or zero-gap AECs could undermine the projected dominance of PEMEC systems. This study thereby reduces barriers to investment in water electrolysis and shows how expert elicitations can help guide near-term investment, policy and research efforts to support the development of electrolysis for low-carbon energy systems.},

For renewable and sustainable energy conversion technologies to play a relevant role at the terrestrial scale, they must be able to scale to the TW level of deployment. This would place a significant demand on the current and future supply of raw materials (chemical elements) used by those technologies. Oftentimes, the average crustal abundance of a chemical element is cited as a measure of its scalability, however another important metric for scalability is the existence (of lack thereof) of mineable ores with a high concentration of the targeted element. This paper aims to provide an overview of the availability of all elements. This is accomplished via a compilation of data for global primary production rates for each element, as a measure of availability at the present time.

Therefore, preparing oxygen-evolving catalysts with lower amounts of the scarce but active and stable iridium is an attractive avenue to overcome this economical constraint.

Because of the rising need for energy storage, potentially facilitated by electrolyzers, improvements to the catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) become increasingly relevant. Standardized protocols have been developed for determining critical figures of merit, such as the electrochemical surface area, mass activity and specif ic activity. Even so, when new and more active catalysts are reported, the catalyst stability tends to play a minor role. In this work, we monitor corrosion on RuO 2  and MnO x  by combining the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). We show that a meaningful estimation of the stability cannot be achieved based on purely electrochemical tests. On the catalysts tested, the anodic dissolution current was four orders of magnitude lower than the total current. We propose that even if long-term testing cannot be replaced, a useful evaluation of the stability can be achieved with short-term tests by using EQCM or ICP-MS. {\textcopyright} 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH},

abstract = {This study discusses the potential of H 2 production by proton exchange membrane water electrolysis as an effective option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the hydrogen sector. To address this topic, a life cycle assessment is conducted to compare proton exchange membrane water electrolysis versus the reference process - steam methane reforming. As a relevant result we show that hydrogen production via proton exchange membrane water electrolysis is a promising technology to reduce CO 2 emissions of the hydrogen sector by up to 75{\%}, if the electrolysis system runs exclusively on electricity generated from renewable energy sources. In a future (2050) base-load operation mode emissions are comparable to the reference system. The results for the global warming potential show a strong reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The thoroughly and in-depth modeled components of the electrolyser have negligible influence on impact categories; thus, emissions are mainly determined by the electricity mix. With 2017 electricity mix of Germany, the global warming potential corresponds to 29.5 kg CO 2 eq. for each kg of produced hydrogen. Referring to the electricity mix we received from an energy model emissions can be reduced to 11.5 kg CO 2 eq. in base-load operation by the year 2050. Using only the 3000 h of excess power from renewables in a year will allow for the reduction of the global warming potential to 3.3 kg CO 2 eq. From this result we see that an environmentally friendly electricity mix is crucial for reducing the global warming impact of electrolytic hydrogen.},

We complement our activity measurements with electrochemistry–mass spectrometry, taken under operando conditions, and transmission electron microscopy and low-energy ion-scattering spectroscopy, taken ex situ. Together with the trends in particle size, the isotope results indicate that oxygen evolution is limited to the near-surface region. Using the surface area of the particles, we determined that the turnover frequency was 6.2 ± 1.6 s−1 at an overpotential of 0.3 V, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest reported for oxygen evolution in alkaline solution.},

abstract = {Surface structural transitions and active sites are identified using X-ray scattering and density functional theory. While the surface atomic structure of RuO 2 has been well studied in ultra high vacuum, much less is known about the interaction between water and RuO 2 in aqueous solution. In this work, in situ surface X-ray scattering measurements combined with density functional theory (DFT) were used to determine the surface structural changes on single-crystal RuO 2 (110) as a function of potential in acidic electrolyte. The redox peaks at 0.7, 1.1 and 1.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) could be attributed to surface transitions associated with the successive deprotonation of –H 2 O on the coordinatively unsaturated Ru sites (CUS) and hydrogen adsorbed to the bridging oxygen sites. At potentials relevant to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an –OO species on the Ru CUS sites was detected, which was stabilized by a neighboring –OH group on the Ru CUS or bridge site. Combining potential-dependent surface structures with their energetics from DFT led to a new OER pathway, where the deprotonation of the –OH group used to stabilize –OO was found to be rate-limiting.},

Herein, we study the catalytic activity and stability of oriented thin films of RuO 2 with (111), (101), and (001) orientations, in comparison to a (110) single crystal and commercial nanoparticles. These surfaces were all tested in aqueous solutions of 0.05 M H 2 SO 4. The initial catalyst activity ranked as follows: (001) {\textgreater} (101) {\textgreater} (111) ≈ (110). We complemented our activity data with inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, to measure Ru dissolution products occurring in parallel to oxygen evolution. In contrast to earlier reports, we find that, under our experimental conditions, there is no correlation between the activity and stability. H ydrogen production provides a means of storing electricity generated from wind and solar energy 1−3 in the form of chemical bonds. Hydrogen-based fuel cells can power vehicles and stationary devices; hydrogen could replace carbon or CO to reduce global CO 2 emissions from chemical and manufacturing processes. Polymer electro-lyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers can synthesize hydrogen near room temperature with rapid start up and shut down, 3 ideally suited toward coupling with renewables.

It has been shown that during successive cyclic voltammetric measurements in H2 18O containing electrolyte the amount of 16O2 (m/z = 32) decreases, with a concomitant increase of 18O16O (m/z = 34) after each cycle before reaching a steady state after four cycles. The obtained higher 16O2 concentration in the evolved oxygen during the first scans is because 16O from the IrO2 film contribute in the oxygen evolution reaction. Analysis of the experimental data has shown that the amount of lattice oxygen, which is involved in the oxygen exchange reaction, is in the order of 1{\%} of the total IrO2 loading. This is an indication that only the outer surface of the oxide electrode participates in the oxygen evolution reaction. In a second series of experiments it has been demonstrated that oxygen evolution on Ir16O2 in H2 18O containing electrolyte result in the formation of Ir18O2. Consequently, we can conclude that the IrO2 layers participate in the oxygen evolution reaction in acid media at least to a several monolayer extend. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In the absence of phosphate buffer, the Tafel slope is increased ∼3-fold and the overall activity is greatly diminished.

abstract = {We study the oxygen reduction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and based on previous obtained mechanistic insight we provide a unified general analysis of the two reactions simultaneously. The analysis shows that control over at least two independent binding energies is required to obtain a reversible perfect catalyst for both ORR and OER. Often only the reactivity of the surface is changed by changing from one material to another and all binding energies scale with the reactivity. We investigate the limitation in efficiency imposed by these linear scaling relations. This analysis gives rise to a double volcano for ORR and OER, with a region in between, forbidden by the scaling relations. The reversible perfect catalyst for both ORR and OER would fall into this ???forbidden region???. Previously, we have found that hydrogen acceptor functionality on oxide surfaces can improve the catalytic performance for OER beyond the limitations originating from the scaling relations. We use this concept to search for promising combinations of binding sites and hydrogen donor/acceptor sites available in transition metal doped graphene, which can act as a catalyst for ORR and OER.

abstract = {The efficiency of the electrolysis process depends on several factors, among which the sluggish kinetic of water oxidation to oxygen, presents a considerable challenge. This reaction is central in natural photo-synthesis, where it occurs at the oxygen-evolving center (OEC). [1,2] This catalytic unit is driven by the light absorbed by photosystem II (PSII) and oxidizes water into oxygen and reducing equivalents. [1,3,4] The OEC shows high efficiencies for water oxidation and an excellent estimated turn-over frequency. [4,5] Achieving such desir-able performances outside the protein environment that surrounds the OEC is difficult, due to the harsh oxidizing con-ditions and the complicated mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) which makes the optimization of the cata-lyst problematic (see section 6 for further discussion). [6] Several catalysts have been proposed to reduce the overpotential losses for OER and inves-tigated in different pH conditions, from acid to alkaline and in neutral pHs with buffer addition. [5,7,8] Among them, transition-metal oxides and hydroxides have proven so far to be the class of materials that show the best performances for OER. For example, IrO 2 is often considered the benchmark catalyst for OER thanks to its superior stability and excellent activity both in acid and basic pH. [8] However, IrO 2 still shows a considerable OER overpotential when compared to the overpotential required by the best catalysts to achieve similar currents for the other half cell reaction, the hydrogen evolution. Furthermore, due to the Ir limited resources and its high price several researchers are looking for strategies to reduce its amount without losing performances (alloy, core/shell particles) [9] or alternative cata-lysts based on earth abundant elements. [5,7,8] In alkaline and near neutral electrolytes, oxides and hydroxides of late first row transition metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) show promising perfor-mances and so they are the subject of deep investigation. [6,10,11] In particular, hydroxides incorporating both Ni and Fe together are reported to show the lowest overpotential for OER in alka-line conditions (pH 13 and 14) and be active also at near neu-tral pH in borate buffer. [12–16] In addition, it has recently been shown that they can be employed as precursors to derive other NiFe-based oxides, [17] nitrides [18] and sulfides [19] with interesting electrocatalytic performances for hydrogen evolution reaction or overall water splitting. Thanks to their high OER activity, NiFe-based hydroxides are investigated also as surface modification of photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting [20–22] and for seawater oxidation. [16] Corrigan firstly investigated their NiFe-based (oxy)hydroxides are highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolu-tion reaction in alkaline electrolyte solutions. These catalysts can be synthe-sized in different ways leading to nanomaterials and thin films with distinct morphologies, stoichiometries and long-range order. Notably, their structure evolves under oxygen evolution operating conditions with respect to the as-synthesized state. Therefore, many researchers have dedicated their efforts on the identification of the catalytic active sites employing in operando exper-imental methods and theoretical calculations. These investigations are pivotal to rationally design materials with outstanding performances that will consti-tute the anodes of practical commercial alkaline electrolyzers. The family of NiFe-based oxyhydroxide catalysts reported in recent years is addressed and the actual state of the research with special focus on the understanding of the oxygen-evolution-reaction active sites and phase is described. Finally, an overview on the proposed oxygen-evolution-reaction mechanisms occurring on NiFe-based oxyhydroxide electrocatalysts is provided.},

Similar results were obtained for polyoriented RuO2 films and particles, in contrast to previous work, suggesting lattice oxygen is not exchanged in catalyzing OER on crystalline RuO2 surfaces.

Significantly, at approximately 2.0 V vs. RHE the first O2 that is evolved consists of two oxygens from the surface oxide, suggesting an oxide decomposition or oxide disproportionation step. At somewhat higher potentials, O2 is formed by a combination of oxygen from the oxide lattice and oxygen provided by water.

We report electrochemical, in situ electrical, photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction measurements on Ni(1-x)Fe(x)(OH)2/Ni(1-x)Fe(x)OOH thin films to investigate the changes in electronic properties, OER activity, and structure as a result of Fe inclusion. We developed a simple method for purification of KOH electrolyte that uses precipitated bulk Ni(OH)2 to absorb Fe impurities. Cyclic voltammetry on rigorously Fe-free Ni(OH)2/NiOOH reveals new Ni redox features and no significant OER current until {\textgreater}400 mV overpotential, different from previous reports which were likely affected by Fe impurities. We show through controlled crystallization that $\beta$-NiOOH is less active for OER than the disordered $\gamma$-NiOOH starting material and that previous reports of increased activity for $\beta$-NiOOH are due to incorporation of Fe-impurities during the crystallization process. Through-film in situ conductivity measurements show a {\textgreater}30-fold increase in film conductivity with Fe addition, but this change in conductivity is not sufficient to explain the observed changes in activity. Measurements of activity as a function of film thickness on Au and glassy carbon substrates are consistent with the hypothesis that Fe exerts a partial-charge-transfer activation effect on Ni, similar to that observed for noble-metal electrode surfaces. These results have significant implications for the design and study of Ni(1-x)Fe(x)OOH OER electrocatalysts, which are the fastest measured OER catalysts under basic conditions.},

abstract = {The nature of the electrochemical water splitting activity of layered pure and Fe-doped NiOOH is investigated using density functional theory calculations. We find similar thermodynamics for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates between the layers of oxyhydroxides, that is, in the bulk of the materials as on the (001) surface. The effect of interlayer spacing on adsorption energy is affected by both the crystal structure and the level of hydrogenation of the active sites. For the Fe-doped NiOOH, we observe general weakening of binding between the different OER intermediates and the catalyst material. The calculated OER activity depends both on doping and interlayer spacing, and our results are generally congruent with available experimental data. These results suggest that such interlayer “bulk” sites may contribute to measured OER activity for both the pure and Fe-doped NiOOH catalysts.},

abstract = {The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an important reaction in the industrial production of numerous inorganic chemicals. However, over the last decade it has also received growing attention as scalable proton- and electron-providing process for use in the production of solar fuels, such as hydrogen, hydrocarbons, or alcohols carried out in water- and CO2-electrolyzers. To operate these devices efficiently and economically , active and stable electrocatalysts are required. While advances have been made in understanding and tuning OER efficiency and activity, the stability of OER catalysts and the reduction of their degradation continue to be major challenges. While most stability studies limit themselves to short-term testing in idealized three-electrode set ups, a much stronger focus on advancing our understanding of degradation of OER catalysts in realistic Membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEAs) with industrial current densities, is critically needed. This review addresses the technical challenges, their scientific basis, as well as recent progress and the road ahead regarding stability and degradation of OER catalysts operating at electrolyzer anodes in acidic MEA environments. First, we start clarifying the complexity associated with the term "catalyst stability", cover today's performance targets and outline major catalyst degradation mechanisms and their mitigation strategies. Then we evaluate suitable in-situ experimental methods to get insight into catalyst degradation and describe achievements in tuning OER catalyst stability. Finally, we highlight the importance of identifying universal figures of merit for stability and develop a comprehensive accelerated life test (ALT) that would yield comparable performance data across labs and catalyst types. As a whole, this review will help to disseminate and highlight the important relations between structure, composition and stability of OER catalysis under different operating conditions.},

Here, we identify the origin of a 500-fold OER activity enhancement that can be achieved with mixed (Ni,Fe)oxyhydroxides (Ni1-xFexOOH) over their pure Ni and Fe parent compounds, resulting in one of the most active currently known OER catalysts in alkaline electrolyte. Operando x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) using high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) reveals that Fe(3+) in Ni1-xFexOOH occupies octahedral sites with unusually short Fe-O bond distances, induced by edge-sharing with surrounding [NiO6] octahedra. Using computational methods, we establish that this structural motif results in near optimal adsorption energies of OER intermediates and low overpotentials at Fe sites. By contrast, Ni sites in Ni1-xFexOOH are not active sites for the oxidation of water.},

The need for better understanding and control of electrode-electrolyte interfaces where these reactions take place, however, implies the continuous need for development of efficient analytical techniques and methodologies capable of providing detailed information about the performance of electrocatalysts, especially in situ, under real operational conditions of electrochemical systems. During the past decade, significant efforts in the fields of electrocatalysis and (electro)analytical chemistry have resulted in the evolution of new powerful methods and approaches providing ever deeper and unique insight into complex and dynamic catalytic systems. The combination of various electrochemical and non-electrochemical methods as well as the application of quantum chemistry calculations has become a viable modern approach in the field. The focus of this critical review is primarily set on discussion of the most recent cutting-edge achievements in the development of analytical techniques and methodologies designed to evaluate three key constituents of the performance of electrocatalysts, namely, activity, selectivity and stability. Possible directions and future challenges in the design and elaboration of analytical methods for electrocatalytic research are outlined.},

abstract = {The recent surge in investigating electrocatalysts for the H2 evolution reaction is based on finding a cheap alternative to Pt. However platinum's excellent catalytic activity means very little catalyst needs to be used. The present study combines model experiments with numerical modeling to determine exactly how little catalyst is needed. Specifically we investigate ultra-low Pt loadings for use in photoelectrochemical H2 evolution using TiO2–Ti-pn+Si photocathodes. At a current density of 10 mA cm−2, we photocathodically evolve H2 at +465, +450, +350 and +270 mV vs., RHE at Pt loadings of 1000, 200, 50, and 10 ng cm−2 corresponding to HER overpotentials of $\eta$1000ng = 32 mV, $\eta$200ng = 46 mV, $\eta$50ng = 142 mV, and $\eta$10ng = 231 mV. To put this in perspective, if 30{\%} of the world's current annual Pt production was used for H2 evolution catalysis, using a loading of 100 ng cm−2 and a current of 10 mA cm−2 would produce 1 TWaverage of H2. The photoelectrochemical data matched the modeling calculations implying that we were near the fundamental maximum in performance for our system. Furthermore modeling indicated that the overpotentials were dominated by mass transfer effects, rather than catalysis unless catalyst loadings were less than 1000 ng cm−2.},

Thus, catalyst optimization would help in substantially reducing the costs for hydrogen production using this technology. Here we show that the activity of plati-num(111) electrodes towards HER is significantly enhanced with just monolayer amounts of copper. Positioning copper atoms into the subsurface layer of platinum weakens the surface binding of adsorbed H-intermediates and provides a twofold activity increase, surpassing the highest specific HER activities reported for acidic media under similar conditions, to the best of our knowledge. These improvements are rationalized using a simple model based on structure-sensitive hydrogen adsorption at platinum and copper-modified platinum surfaces. This model also solves a long-lasting puzzle in electrocatalysis, namely why polycrystalline platinum electrodes are more active than platinum(111) for the HER.},

abstract = {We present the construction and some first applications of an On-line electrochemical mass spectrometry system for detecting volatile products formed during electrochemical reactions at a single-crystal electrode in hanging meniscus configuration. The system is based on a small inlet tip made of porous Teflon and a Peek holder, which is brought in close proximity (ca. 10-20 lm) to the electrode surface. The tip is connected to the mass spectrometer by glass and metal tubing. Because of the small amount of gas entering the mass spectrometer, no differential pumping is needed during the measurement. The tip construction and preparation introduced here leads to reproducible voltammetry with very good cleanliness characteristics. The presence of the tip has no significant influence on the blank voltammetry of a Pt(111) in sulfuric acid, and on voltammetric responses for CO adlayer oxidation, methanol oxidation, and hydroxylamine electrochemistry on Pt(111). The formation of gaseous products in these reactions can be followed accurately and is in good agreement with earlier results obtained by other mass spectrometric or spectroscopic techniques. The time response and tailing of the setup is on the order of seconds and mainly determined by the distance between the tip and the electrode.},

abstract = {The discovery of electrocatalysts that can efficiently reduce CO2 to fuels with high selectivity is a subject of contemporary interest. Currently, the available analytical methods for characterizing the products of CO2 reduction require tens of hours to obtain the dependence of the product distribution on the applied potential. As a consequence, there is a need to develop novel analytical approaches that can reduce this analysis time down to about an hour. We report here the design, construction, and operation of a novel differential electrochemical mass spectrometer (DEMS) cell geometry that enables the partial current densities of volatile electrochemical reaction products to be quantified in real time. The capabilities of the novel DEMS cell design are demonstrated by carrying out the electrochemical reduction of CO2 over polycrystalline copper. The reaction products are quantified in real time as a function of the applied potential during linear sweep voltammetry, enabling the product spectrum produced by a given electrocatalyst to be determined as a function of the applied potential on the timescale of roughly one hour.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND With a rising global population, increasing energy demands, and impending climate change, major concerns have been raised over the security of our energy future. Developing sustainable, fossil-free pathways to produce fuels and chemicals of global importance could play a major role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions while providing the feedstocks needed to make the products we use on a daily basis. One prospective goal is to develop electrochemical conversion processes that can convert molecules in the atmosphere (e.g., water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen) into higher-value products (e.g., hydrogen, hydrocarbons, oxygenates, and ammonia) by coupling to renewable energy. Electrocatalysts play a key role in these energy conversion technologies because they increase the rate, efficiency, and selectivity of the chemical transformations involved. Today's electrocatalysts, however, are inadequate. The grand challenge is to develop advanced electrocatalysts with the enhanced performance needed to enable widespread penetration of clean energy technologies. ADVANCES Over the past decade, substantial progress has been made in understanding several key electrochemical transformations, particularly those that involve water, hydrogen, and oxygen. The combination of theoretical and experimental studies working in concert has proven to be a successful strategy in this respect, yielding a framework to understand catalytic trends that can ultimately provide rational guidance toward the development of improved catalysts. Catalyst design strategies that aim to increase the number of active sites and/or increase the intrinsic activity of each active site have been successfully developed. The field of hydrogen evolution, for example, has seen important breakthroughs over the years in the development of highly active non–precious metal catalysts in acid. Notable advancements have also been made in the design of oxygen reduction and evolution catalysts, although there remains substantial room for improvement. The combination of theory and experiment elucidates the remaining challenges in developing further improved catalysts, often involving scaling relations among reactive intermediates. This understanding serves as an initial platform to design strategies to circumvent technical obstacles, opening up opportunities and approaches to develop higher-performance electrocatalysts for a wide range of reactions. OUTLOOK A systematic framework of combining theory and experiment in electrocatalysis helps to uncover broader governing principles that can be used to understand a wide variety of electrochemical transformations. These principles can be applied to other emerging and promising clean energy reactions, including hydrogen peroxide production, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction, among others. Although current paradigms for catalyst development have been helpful to date, a number of challenges need to be successfully addressed in order to achieve major breakthroughs. One important frontier, for example, is the development of both experimental and computational methods that can rapidly elucidate reaction mechanisms on broad classes of materials and in a wide range of operating conditions (e.g., pH, solvent, electrolyte). Such efforts would build on current frameworks for understanding catalysis to provide the deeper insights needed to fine-tune catalyst properties in an optimal manner. The long-term goal is to continue improving the activity and selectivity of these catalysts in order to realize the prospects of using renewable energy to provide the fuels and chemicals that we need for a sustainable energy future. , Electrocatalysis plays a central role in clean energy conversion, enabling a number of sustainable processes for future technologies. This review discusses design strategies for state-of-the-art heterogeneous electrocatalysts and associated materials for several different electrochemical transformations involving water, hydrogen, and oxygen, using theory as a means to rationalize catalyst performance. By examining the common principles that govern catalysis for different electrochemical reactions, we describe a systematic framework that clarifies trends in catalyzing these reactions, serving as a guide to new catalyst development while highlighting key gaps that need to be addressed. We conclude by extending this framework to emerging clean energy reactions such as hydrogen peroxide production, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction, where the development of improved catalysts could allow for the sustainable production of a broad range of fuels and chemicals. , Better living through water-splitting Chemists have known how to use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for more than 200 years. Nonetheless, because the electrochemical route is inefficient, most of the hydrogen made nowadays comes from natural gas. Seh et al. review recent progress in electrocatalyst development to accelerate water-splitting, the reverse reactions that underlie fuel cells, and related oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide reductions. A unified theoretical framework highlights the need for catalyst design strategies that selectively stabilize distinct reaction intermediates relative to each other.

abstract = {Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) can be used not only to identify products or intermediates of continuous faradaic reactions, but also to characterize submonolayer amounts of adsorbates on polycrystalline and single crystal electrode surfaces by means of their desorption, because of its high sensitivity. One possibility to achieve this is to oxidize a carbonaceous species to CO {\$}\backslash{\$}n 2, which is quantitatively detected in the mass spectrometer. Many adsorbates can also be desorbed at certain potentials as such, or as the hydrogenated product, allowing a more direct characterization of the adsorbate. In some cases, a nonreactive desorption can be induced by displacement with a second adsorbate, yielding additional information. Interfacing an electrochemical cell to a mass spectrometer via a porous Teflon membrane can be achieved with a variety of cells. These will be described together with their specific advantages and characteristics. ?? 2004 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.},

abstract = {A novel microfabricated chemical reactor for highly sensitive measurements of catalytic activity and surface kinetics is presented. The reactor is fabricated in a silicon chip and is intended for gas-phase reactions at pressures ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 bar. A high sensitivity is obtained by directing the entire gas flow through the catalyst bed to a mass spectrometer, thus ensuring that nearly all reaction products are present in the analyzed gas flow. Although the device can be employed for testing a wide range of catalysts, the primary aim of the design is to allow characterization of model catalysts which can only be obtained in small quantities. Such measurements are of significant fundamental interest but are challenging because of the low surface areas involved. The relationship between the reaction zone gas flow and the pressure in the reaction zone is investigated experimentally. A corresponding theoretical model is presented, and the gas flow through an on-chip flow-limiting capillary is predicted to be in the intermediate regime. The experimental data for the gas flow are found to be in good agreement with the theoretical model. At typical experimental conditions, the total gas flow through the reaction zone is around 3x10(14) molecules s(-1), corresponding to a gas residence time in the reaction zone of about 11 s. To demonstrate the operation of the microreactor, CO oxidation on low-area platinum thin film circles is employed as a test reaction. Using temperature ramping, it is found that platinum catalysts with areas as small as 15 microm(2) are conveniently characterized with the device.},

abstract = {The field of electrocatalysis has undergone tremendous advancement in the past few decades, in part owing to improvements in catalyst design at the nanoscale. These developments have been crucial for the realization of and improvement in alternative energy technologies based on electrochemical reactions such as fuel cells. Through the development of novel synthesis methods, characterization techniques and theoretical methods, rationally designed nanoscale electrocatalysts with tunable activity and selectivity have been achieved. This Review explores how nanostructures can be used to control electrochemical reactivity, focusing on three model reactions: O2 electroreduction, CO2 electroreduction and ethanol electrooxidation. The mechanisms behind nanoscale control of reactivity are discussed, such as the presence of low-coordinated sites or facets, strain, ligand effects and bifunctional effects in multimetallic materials. In particular, studies of how particle size, shape and composition in nanostructures can be used to tune reactivity are highlighted.},

@article{Chan2015a,
abstract = {A major challenge in the theoretical treatment of electrochemical charge transfer barriers is that simulations are performed at constant charge, which leads to dramatic potential shifts along the reaction path. Real electrochemical systems, however, operate at constant potential, which corresponds to a hypothetical model system of infinite size. Previous studies of hydrogen evolution have relied on a computationally costly scheme that extrapolates the barriers calculated on increasingly larger cells, and extension of this scheme to more complex reactions would be prohibitively costly. We present a new method to determine constant potential reaction energetics for simple charge transfer reactions that requires only (1) a single barrier calculation in an electrochemical environment and (2) the corresponding surface charge at the initial, transition, and final states. This method allows for a tremendous reduction in the computational resources required to determine electrochemical barriers and paves the way for a rigorous DFT-based kinetic analysis of electrochemical reactions beyond hydrogen evolution.},

@article{Reier2017,
abstract = {The low efficiency of the electrocatalytic oxidation of water to O-2 (oxygen evolution reaction-OER) is considered as one of the major roadblocks for the storage of electricity from renewable sources in form of molecular fuels like H-2 or hydrocarbons. Especially in acidic environments, compatible with the powerful proton exchange membrane (PEM), an earth-abundant OER catalyst that combines high activity and high stability is still unknown. Current PEM-compatible OER catalysts still rely mostly on Ir and/or Ru as active components, which are both very scarce elements of the platinum group. Hence, the Ir and/or Ru amount in OER catalysts has to be strictly minimized. Unfortunately, the OER mechanism, which is the most powerful tool for OER catalyst optimization, still remains unclear. In this review, we first summarize the current state of our understanding of the OER mechanism on PEM-compatible heterogeneous electrocatalysts, before we compare and contrast that to the OER mechanism on homogenous catalysts. Thereafter, an overview over monometallic OER catalysts is provided to obtain insights into structure-function relations followed by a review of current material optimization concepts and support materials. Moreover, missing links required to complete the mechanistic picture as well as the most promising material optimization concepts are pointed out.},

@article{Carmo2013,
abstract = {Hydrogen is often considered the best means by which to store energy coming from renewable and intermittent power sources. With the growing capacity of localized renewable energy sources surpassing the gigawatt range, a storage system of equal magnitude is required. PEM electrolysis provides a sustainable solution for the production of hydrogen, and is well suited to couple with energy sources such as wind and solar. However, due to low demand in electrolytic hydrogen in the last century, little research has been done on PEM electrolysis with many challenges still unexplored. The ever increasing desire for green energy has rekindled the interest on PEM electrolysis, thus the compilation and recovery of past research and developments is important and necessary. In this review, PEM water electrolysis is comprehensively highlighted and discussed. The challenges new and old related to electrocatalysts, solid electrolyte, current collectors, separator plates and modeling efforts will also be addressed. The main message is to clearly set the state-of-the-art for the PEM electrolysis technology, be insightful of the research that is already done and the challenges that still exist. This information will provide several future research directions and a road map in order to aid scientists in establishing PEM electrolysis as a commercially viable hydrogen production solution.

abstract = {Rational design of selective CO2-to-fuels electrocatalysts requires direct knowledge of the electrode surface structure during turnover. Metallic Cu is the most versatile CO2-to-fuels catalyst, capable of generating a wide array of value-added products, including methane, ethylene, and ethanol. All of these products are postulated to form via a common surface-bound CO intermediate. Therefore, the kinetics and thermodynamics of CO adsorption to Cu play a central role in determining fuel-formation selectivity and efficiency, highlighting the need for direct observation of CO surface binding equilibria under catalytic conditions. Here, we synthesize nanostructured Cu films adhered to IR-transparent Si prisms, and we find that these Cu surfaces enhance IR absorption of bound molecules. Using these films as electrodes, we examine Cu-catalyzed CO2 reduction in situ via IR spectroelectrochemistry. We observe that Cu surfaces bind electrogenerated CO, derived from CO2, beginning at −0.60 V vs RHE with increasing ...},
